## Setup your repository

### Sign up for Project

Sign up for the project repository here:
TODO
[https://classroom.github.com/a/Nd5l5pVc](https://classroom.github.com/a/Nd5l5pVc)

After your repository has initialized it, clone it to your computer. I recommend
putting it in your `ap-csp` directory.

After you've cloned your repository, run the `setup.sh` script in the root of
that repository to initialize it's configuration.

Upon completion it should display a message similar to this one:

```
######################################################
# SETUP IS COMPLETE. YOU SHOULD NOW CREATE A         #
# `develop` BRANCH BY RUNNING THE FOLLOWING COMMAND: #
#                                                    #
# git checkout -b develop                            #
#                                                    #
# THEN PUSH THAT BRANCH TO GITHUB BY RUNNING THE     #
# FOLLOWING COMMAND:                                 #
#                                                    #
# git push -u origin develop                         #
#                                                    #
# AFTER PUSHING, OPEN A PULL REQUEST FROM YOUR       #
# `develop`  BRANCH TO THE `main` BRANCH BY VISITING #
# THIS REPO ON GITHUB, CLICKING `Pull Requests`      #
# THEN `New pull request`. THE BASE BRANCH SHOULD BE #
# `main` and THE COMPARE BRANCH SHOULD BE `develop`. #
#                                                    #
# FINALLY, ADD YOUR INSTRUCTOR AS A REVIEWER ON      #
# GITHUB. THIS IS HOW YOUR INSTRUCTOR WILL SEE YOUR  #
# WORK.                                              #

```

Follow the directions to create a `develop` branch as well as pushing your
`develop` branch to Github.

Finally, create a pull request from your `develop` branch to the `main` branch
and assign `jcollard` as a reviewer.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1

Due: Thursday Dec. 3rd @ 8am

For the first milestone, you will select a template from an HTML/CSS template
site to use as your new portfolio theme. Then, transfer the content of your
previous portfolio to that new theme.

Sites that offer free templates:

* [W3 Schools Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp)
* [Template MO](https://templatemo.com/tag/portfolio)
* [Free CSS](https://www.free-css.com/template-categories/portfolio)

Of course, you are not limited to the templates from these sites. You can select
any template you want. The main goal here is to amp up your portfolio and make
it look as professional as possible.

Finally, update your projects section describing your Beach Resort project. Be
sure to talk about all of the features of the Beach Resort page, screen shots
and a link to the Beach Resort home page that allows visitors to browse throught
the page.

All code that you would like to count toward your evaluation should be part of a
`tag` on in your repository called `milestone-1`. This can be created by running
`git tag milestone-1`. Then push your tag to your repository by running `git
push -u origin milestone-1` The date of this tag creation will be used to
determine when your work was submitted. 

### Milestone 2

Due: Thursday Dec 10th @ 8 AM

Next, update the projects section of your portfolio to be an interactive
gallery. Like the one in this [VIDEO](#)

#### JavaScript Basics

To help you get started, here are several videos that will guide you through
connecting JavaScript to your pages as well as how to control your HTML content
through JavaScript

1. [Adding JavaScript to an HTML Page](#)
2. [The onload Event](#)
3. [The onclick Event](#)

All code that you would like to count toward your evaluation should be part of a
`tag` on in your repository called `milestone-2`. This can be created by running
`git tag milestone-2`. Then push your tag to your repository by running `git
push -u origin milestone-2` The date of this tag creation will be used to
determine when your work was submitted. 

### Milestone 3

Due: Monday Dec 14th @ 8 AM

Propose and implements a feature on your portfolio that utilizes JavaScript. You
should propose your idea on Piazza so others might get an idea of their own.

Example Ideas:

* Auto Scrolling Gallery
* Drop Down Menu
* A Clock or Countdown Timer

All code that you would like to count toward your evaluation should be part of a
`tag` on in your repository called `milestone-3`. This can be created by running
`git tag milestone-3`. Then push your tag to your repository by running `git
push -u origin milestone-3` The date of this tag creation will be used to
determine when your work was submitted. 


## Grading

## Getting Help

All questions should be posted to the class Piazza board. You are also
encouraged to help other students who post on Piazza. When you post your
question, be sure to include as many details as possible for reproducing the
issue you're having.

Questions you should answer when asking a question include:

1. What are you trying to do?
2. What did you try?
3. What was the result?

Work hard to make sure the person trying to answer your question can reproduce
your error. Share your files so others can run exactly what you're running.

Also, include screenshot!

Formulating good questions is a good life long skill. You should try asking your
question on Piazza before seeking out synchronous time with Mx. Collard.
However, if you would like to meet to discuss synchronously, first, look at [Mx.
Collard's Calendar](http://tinyurl.com/mx-collard-calendar), then send them an
email with at least two proposed times you would like to meet.
